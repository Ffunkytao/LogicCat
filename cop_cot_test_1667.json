This suggests the query provided may not match the problem; instead, it calculates TNT equivalent from calories burned.

Hypothetically, if such fields existed, they might be in 'usage_records' or a related table.\n\n【step2】: Since the SQL query given does not address the problem (it groups by activity type and filters on TNT equivalent), reinterpret the problem: It likely requires filtering records where a hypothetical 'Max_Lyapunov_Index' field is > 0.5 and an 'Is_Abnormal' field is false.

If fields existed, a basic SELECT with WHERE clause would be used, e.g., SELECT * FROM usage_records WHERE Max_Lyapunov_Index > 0.5 AND Is_Abnormal = FALSE.\n\n【step3】: Due to the schema mismatch, the query cannot be executed as described.
